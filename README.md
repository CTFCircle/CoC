# Code of Conduct - CTF Circle

Our Principles
----------

CTF Circle is organized around three affirmative principles:

1) Intersectional Feminism

    We oppose systems of domination (such as sexism and racism) and recognize that they interact with each other in complex ways.
    
2) Mutual Aid

    We help each other as colleagues and equals because we want to improve together.
    
3) Leading by Example

    Don't wait or ask for permission to do something good; start doing it, and others will want to participate. We become the models and mentors that we needed, and set others up for success in the future. We make the path.

Our Pledge
----------

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

-   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
-   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
-   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
-   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
-   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-   Physical contact and simulated physical contact (including textual descriptions) without consent or after a request to stop
-   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
-   Deliberate misgendering or use of "dead" or rejected names
-   Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent

Culture of Consent
------------------

Our community operates on an "affirmative consent" model. At its core, this means:

- Consent is a positive thing!
- Yes means yes
- The absence of no is insufficient; it does *not* mean yes
- A yes to one activity is not a yes to another activity or the same activity at a future time
- Should you receive a "no", accept it graciously; do not devalue, criticize, or coerce
- A yes can be withdrawn at any time and for any reason, with or without an explanation given

Enforcement Responsibilities
----------------------------

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. A current list of these members can be retrieved using the [list of Slack admins](https://ctfcircle.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins) and reports may be made to any of these individuals. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
